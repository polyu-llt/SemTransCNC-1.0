## Description : 
SemTransCNC 1.0 is a semantic transparency dataset of Chinese nominal compound which was built using a series of Mechanical Turk-based experiments. It consists of the overall and the constituent semantic transparency (OST, CST respectively) data of 1,176 dimorphemic Chinese nominal compounds which consist of free morphemes and which have mid-range frequencies. The paper Wang et al. (2014), "Building a semantic transparency dataset of Chinese nominal compounds: A practice of crowdsourcing methodology" describes the details of the construction of the dataset. The dataset is in CSV format which has 11 columns. The columns "WORD" and "WORDT" list Chinese nominal compounds in simplified and traditional Chinese characters respectively. The column "STRUCT" stores the morphological structure of the compounds. The columns "FREQ" and "RFREQ" show the absolute and relative frequencies respectively of the compounds according to the Sinica Corpus V4.0. The columns "NOST", "NC1CST", and "NC2CST" respectively store the overall semantic transparency value of each compound and the constituent semantic transparency values of both constituents of each compound; in these columns, 1 means completely transparent and 0 means completely opaque. The columns "OSD", "C1SD", and "C2SD" are the standard deviations of the overall and constituent semantic transparency rating data of each compound.
